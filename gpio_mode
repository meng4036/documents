## GPIO Pin Configuration Settings

As well as configuring pins to have either a pull‐up or a pull‐down resistor
configuration, there are also seven different modes for each pin. This is called
the multiplexer mode (mmode) for the pin and it is set using a three‐digit
binary number, as described in the first row of Table 6-1. This table is 
based on information provided in the AM335x TRM (GPIOs conf_<module>_<pin> ‐ Table 9‐60
of the TRM). Using these bit settings, you can construct a seven‐bit value that
can be used to configure the exact behavior of a GPIO pin within Linux using
device tree overlays, which is discussed shortly.

Table 6-1: GPIO Pin User‐Configuration Settings

| BIT | AM335x FIELD | DESCRIPTION |
|-----| --------------| ------------ |
| 0,1,2 | mmode | The multiplexer mode: Using the three least‐significant bits. you can select a mode between 0 and 7, e.g., 000=0, 111=7. This enables each pin to have up to eight different modes.|
|  3 | puden | Enable internal pull‐up/pull‐down resistor: Enable=0, Disable=1.|
| 4  | putypesel | Select internal pull‐up or pull‐down form: Pull‐down=0, Pull‐up=1.|
| 5 | rxactive | Input Active: Receiver disabled=0, Input enabled=1. If this bits set high, the pin will be an input; otherwise, it will be an output. |
| 6 | slewctrl | Slew Control: Fast=0, Slow=1. Slew rate provides control over the rise/fall time of an output. You would only set this value to slow if you were using long interconnects, such as on I2C buses. |

NOTE: There is a video on the use of these settings on the web page associated with
this chapter at www.exploringbeaglebone.com/chapter6/ and at tiny.cc/
ebb601 that you can refer to while reading this chapter.


The mmode is discussed shortly, but when working with GPIOs the mmode
will be 7, and therefore the most common hexadecimal values that are used to
configure a GPIO’s settings are as follows (bit 6 is the most significant bit (MSB)
and is on the LHS):

- 0x27 (0100111) Fast, Input, Pull‐Down, Enabled and Mux Mode 7
- 0x37 (0110111) Fast, Input, Pull‐Up, Enabled, Mux Mode 7
- 0x07 (0000111) Fast, Output, Pull‐down, Enabled, Mux Mode 7
- 0x17 (0010111) Fast, Output, Pull‐up, Enabled, Mux Mode 7

These configuration values are very useful, as they enable you to set the
pins into the exact operational mode that you require.
